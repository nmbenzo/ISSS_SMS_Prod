# ISSS SMS Prod
A chatbot for international students at the University of San Francisco to communicate with. 

This service allows students to chat with a bot and ask a variety of questions common to F-1 international students 
studying at the University of San Francisco. 

The project has been deployed to AWS Lambda via the Zappa package for Python 3.6.

The SMS Project has now been updated to integrate with Google DialogFlow via the
dialogflow v2 API.
